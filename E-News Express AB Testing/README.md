📰 E-news Express – Business Statistics
🎯 Objective
Assess the effectiveness of a redesigned landing page by evaluating its impact on user conversion and engagement using statistical techniques.

📊 Problem Statement
Landing page performance plays a critical role in user retention and engagement. This project evaluates whether a new landing page design improves conversion rates compared to the existing version, using statistical hypothesis testing and A/B testing methods.

🔍 Project Overview
Goal: Determine if the new landing page leads to higher conversion and engagement

Dataset: Web analytics data capturing user interactions from control (old page) and treatment (new page) groups

Target Variable: Binary outcome – Conversion (Yes/No)

🧠 Statistical Approach
🔧 Data Preparation
Cleaned and validated user activity data

Grouped users into control and treatment populations

Verified sample sizes and conversion distribution

🧪 Hypothesis Testing
Null Hypothesis (H₀): No significant difference in conversion rates

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): New landing page improves conversion rate

Used a 2-proportion Z-test to assess statistical significance

Significance level: α = 0.05

✅ Results
Metric	Control Group	Treatment Group
Conversion Rate	Lower	Higher
Statistical Outcome	p < 0.05	Significant

The test showed statistically significant improvement in the treatment group

Higher conversion and engagement metrics support adopting the new design
