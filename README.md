# 👋 Hi, I'm Kalyani Aluru

With over 17 years of experience across IT and Data Science, I specialize in building machine learning solutions, predictive analytics models, and enterprise data strategies that drive measurable business impact. From reducing healthcare data errors to fraud detection and pricing optimization, I’ve delivered value at scale in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and retail.

🔍 My core focus areas:
- Machine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised)
- Predictive Modeling & A/B Testing
- Data Analytics & Visualization (Python, SQL, Tableau)
- Model Deployment & Data Pipelines (Databricks, Snowflake, Azure, AWS)

💼 Currently @ Capital One | Previously @ Anthem, Walmart, D&B (via IBM)
